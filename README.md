# Fulgurite CSS
Personal CSS "framework". AKA a bunch of CSS that I'd already been using, thrown together into one neat little package with some extra functionality.

It's pretty opinionated (and weird) in how it handles a lot of things and I'd really recommend not using it unless you're me. Lmao. This is very catered to my personal style.

However, it does rely heavily on per-site customization and does not have a sane default style. This is because the CSS itself needed to be fairly versatile and usable by multiple websites in different styles.




There are no examples or documentation right now, but there will be eventually! Hopefully.

## Usage
Please use (cdn pending) or host `dist/fulgurite.min.css` yourself.

A couple additional features are not bundled with the main `fulgurite.css` file itself. These are the following (with `dist` as the root directory)
- `extras/background.css` - for extensive background styling
- `extras/gallery.css` - specifically made for usage with [viewerjs](https://fengyuanchen.github.io/viewerjs/), for image gallery functionality
- `extras/palette.css` - adds success, warning, error, info and accent colors and some basic styling including those
